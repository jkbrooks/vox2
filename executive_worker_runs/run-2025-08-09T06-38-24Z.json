  "llm_plan": "1. **Review Ticket Requirements**: Read the ticket details to understand the expectations for the LLM plan and the cargo check process.\n\n2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure the development environment is configured with the necessary tools (e.g., Rust, Cargo) to run the tests.\n\n3. **Implement LLM Plan Execution**: Write a function or script to execute the LLM plan as specified in the ticket.\n\n4. **Integrate Cargo Check**: Add a step in the script to run `cargo check` after executing the LLM plan to ensure the code compiles without errors.\n\n5. **Skip Documentation Build**: Modify the script to explicitly skip the documentation build process as per the ticket requirements.\n\n6. **Capture Output in run.json**: Ensure that the output of the execution is captured in a `run.json` file, including the fields `compiled=true` and `llm_plan`.\n\n7. **Test the Implementation**: Run the complete script to verify that it executes correctly and that the `run.json` file is generated with the expected content.\n\n8. **Review and Refine**: Check the output and make any necessary adjustments to ensure compliance with the acceptance criteria.\n\n9. **Document Changes**: Update any relevant documentation or comments in the codebase to reflect the new functionality.\n\n10. **Submit for Review**: Create a pull request with the changes and request a review from team members to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.",
