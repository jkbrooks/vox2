  "eoi": null,
  "llm_plan": "1. **Review Ticket Requirements**: Read the ticket summary and acceptance criteria to ensure a clear understanding of the expected outcomes.\n\n2. **Set Up Development Environment**: Ensure that the development environment is configured correctly with all necessary dependencies for the Executive Worker.\n\n3. **Implement LLM Plan Generation**: Write the code to generate an LLM plan as specified in the ticket. This will serve as the first step in the smoke test.\n\n4. **Run Cargo Check**: Execute `cargo check` to verify that the code compiles correctly without any errors. This step ensures that the project is in a good state before proceeding.\n\n5. **Create task_tree.yaml**: Write the logic to generate the `task_tree.yaml` file based on the LLM plan. This file will outline the tasks to be executed.\n\n6. **Generate run.json**: Implement the code to create the `run.json` file, ensuring it includes the generated LLM plan and sets `validation.compiled` to true.\n\n7. **Validate Output Files**: Check the contents of `task_tree.yaml` and `run.json` to confirm they meet the requirements outlined in the acceptance criteria.\n\n8. **Run Smoke Test**: Execute the complete end-to-end process to ensure that all components work together seamlessly and produce the expected output files.\n\n9. **Document Results**: Record the outcomes of the smoke test, noting any issues or discrepancies encountered during the process.\n\n10. **Submit for Review**: Prepare the changes for review, including any documentation or notes on the implementation, and submit a pull request to the repository.",
