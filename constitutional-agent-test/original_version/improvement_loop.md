# Context Management Improvement Loop

## Overview
This document describes the iterative improvement process for the context management system, leveraging constitutional reflections and empirical testing to evolve the system.

## Current State
- **context_manager.py**: Version 0.5 (simplified implementation)
- **prompt_strategy.md**: Version 1.0 (full design specification)
- **Gap**: Not all features from the strategy are implemented in the manager

## The Improvement Loop

### Phase 1: Baseline Testing
1. Run the constitutional agent on a test task
2. Compare performance against baseline Cursor implementation
3. Log all context injections and their usage
4. Capture constitutional reflections during execution

### Phase 2: Analysis
1. Review which context was actually used vs ignored
2. Identify patterns in constitutional reflections about missing/wrong context
3. Compare actual behavior against prompt_strategy.md intentions
4. Note any emergent patterns not anticipated in the design

### Phase 3: Evolution Decision
Based on analysis, decide whether to:
- **Option A**: Implement more features from prompt_strategy.md v1.0 into context_manager.py
- **Option B**: Revise prompt_strategy.md based on learnings (creating v1.1)
- **Option C**: Maintain the gap but document why certain features aren't needed
- **Option D**: Create alternative strategies for specific use cases

### Phase 4: Implementation
1. Update context_manager.py with chosen improvements
2. Increment version number with changelog
3. Update tests to cover new behavior
4. Document rationale for changes in constitutional reflection format

### Phase 5: Validation
1. Re-run the same test task with updated system
2. Measure improvement in relevant metrics:
   - Token efficiency (useful tokens / total tokens)
   - Task completion quality
   - Constitutional insight generation rate
   - Stakeholder concern coverage
3. Compare against previous iteration

## Example Improvement Triggers

### From Constitutional Reflections
```
CONSTITUTIONAL_INSIGHT:
- EoI: Context Management System
- Stakeholders Affected: Agent (self), Developer (user)
- Concerns Addressed: Token waste on irrelevant ISO definitions in execution mode
- Architectural Principle: Context should be phase-aware, not just mode-aware
- Correspondence: Relates to prompt_strategy.md section on "Phase Triggers"
- Action: Implement phase detection in context_manager.py v0.6
```

### From Empirical Observation
- Agent repeatedly requests same information → Add caching
- Context switches cause confusion → Add transition context
- Certain stakeholders never referenced → Adjust priority weights

## Metrics for Success

1. **Efficiency Metrics**
   - Token utilization rate (target: >70% of injected tokens referenced)
   - Context switch overhead (target: <500 tokens per switch)
   - Cache hit rate once implemented (target: >30%)

2. **Quality Metrics**
   - Task completion accuracy vs baseline
   - Number of constitutional insights generated
   - Reduction in context-related errors

3. **Stigmergy Metrics**
   - Quality of data trails left for future agents
   - Successful reuse of previous agent's context
   - Cross-agent learning rate

## Implementation Example

```python
# Future context_manager.py v0.6 snippet
class ContextManager:
    def __init__(self):
        self.version = "0.6"
        self.changelog = {
            "0.5": "Initial simplified implementation",
            "0.6": "Added phase awareness based on reflection #001"
        }
        
    def get_phase(self, task_history):
        """Detect project phase from task history"""
        # Implemented based on constitutional reflection
        if len(task_history) < 5:
            return "exploration"
        elif self.has_repeated_patterns(task_history):
            return "execution"
        else:
            return "refinement"
```

## Demonstrating Stigmergy Value

Each iteration of this loop:
1. Leaves better data trails (improved logging, clearer rationales)
2. Makes the system more self-documenting
3. Creates examples for other developers to follow
4. Builds a corpus of constitutional reflections that inform future improvements

## Next Steps

1. Complete initial test run with v0.5
2. Gather constitutional reflections and metrics
3. Run first improvement loop iteration
4. Document changes and rationale
5. Share results as example for other teams

## Notes

- The gap between prompt_strategy.md and context_manager.py is intentional and productive
- It allows the strategy to be aspirational while implementation remains pragmatic
- Future users can choose which features to implement based on their needs
- The versioning system allows tracking which ideas have been validated in practice
