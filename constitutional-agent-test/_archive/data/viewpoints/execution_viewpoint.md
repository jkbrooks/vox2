# Execution Viewpoint

## Purpose
This viewpoint focuses on the immediate task at hand and how to complete it effectively.

## Key Questions
- What exactly needs to be done?
- What are the success criteria?
- What tools and resources are available?
- What is the most efficient path to completion?
- What could block progress?

## Concerns Addressed
- Task clarity and definition
- Resource availability
- Time efficiency
- Quality of implementation
- Dependency management

## Perspective
When viewing the system through this viewpoint, focus on:
- Concrete, actionable steps
- Clear inputs and outputs
- Measurable progress
- Immediate obstacles and solutions
- Local optimizations within task boundaries

## Relationship to Constitutional Thinking
While executing, remain aware that:
- Patterns observed during execution may inform systemic improvements
- Obstacles encountered might reveal architectural issues
- Success strategies could be generalized for future use
