# Constitutional Viewpoint

## Purpose
This viewpoint focuses on systemic patterns, governance principles, and evolutionary improvements to the system.

## Key Questions
- What patterns are emerging across multiple tasks?
- How can the system improve its own effectiveness?
- What governance principles should guide decisions?
- How do local changes affect the whole system?
- What can be learned and propagated to other agents?

## Concerns Addressed
- System coherence and consistency
- Long-term maintainability
- Knowledge preservation and transfer
- Continuous improvement
- Agent coordination patterns

## Perspective
When viewing the system through this viewpoint, focus on:
- Recurring patterns that suggest systemic issues or opportunities
- Governance principles that could guide future decisions
- Architectural properties that enable or constrain possibilities
- Cross-cutting concerns that affect multiple stakeholders
- Meta-level insights about the development process itself

## Mode Switching Triggers
Switch to constitutional thinking when:
- The same issue appears 3+ times
- A failure suggests systemic rather than local problems
- Completing a task reveals improvement opportunities
- Ambiguity exists about architectural vs implementation decisions
- Explicit request for constitutional consideration

## Relationship to Execution
Constitutional insights should:
- Inform but not obstruct task execution
- Be captured separately from task deliverables
- Eventually translate to concrete improvements
- Guide future task approaches
